# Internal Channel Audit

Document and evaluate internal reporting attempts before external disclosure, establishing good faith and demonstrating futility of internal channels.

---

## When to Use

- Preparing to escalate from internal to external reporting
- User says "Have I exhausted internal channels?" or "Document my reporting attempts"
- Building the record that shows why external disclosure became necessary
- Evaluating whether more internal options should be tried first
- Creating audit trail for legal protection

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| attempts | Yes | What internal reporting has been done |
| responses | No | How the organization responded |
| channels_available | No | What internal options exist |
| organization_context | No | Type of organization and its reporting structure |

---

## Why Internal Channels Matter

### Legal Protection
Many whistleblower protection statutes require good-faith internal reporting before external disclosure. Your record of trying internal channels first is evidence of good faith.

### Credibility
When you go external, opponents will ask: "Why didn't you try to fix this internally first?" Your answer needs to be documented.

### Effectiveness
Sometimes internal channels work. If they might work, try them—fixing the problem is the goal, not disclosure itself.

### Ethics
Organizations deserve the chance to correct problems before public exposure—if they have functional correction mechanisms.

---

## The Ellsberg Standard

Ellsberg spent years trying to get the Pentagon Papers to people who could act on them through proper channels:

1. Briefed Henry Kissinger (Nixon's National Security Advisor)
2. Approached multiple senators
3. Tried to have the documents officially declassified
4. Attempted to get them entered into congressional record

Only after these channels failed—demonstrably, documentably failed—did he go to the press.

**The principle:** Exhaust legitimate internal options. Document the exhaustion.

---

## Channel Categories

### Tier 1: Direct Chain
- Immediate supervisor
- Supervisor's manager
- Executive leadership

**When this works:** Problem is unknown to leadership; leadership cares about fixing it.
**When this fails:** Leadership is complicit; chain is captured; pattern of ignoring reports.

### Tier 2: Compliance/Ethics
- Ethics hotline
- Compliance department
- Internal ombudsman
- Legal department (if applicable)

**When this works:** Independent compliance function; regulatory pressure on organization.
**When this fails:** Compliance reports to those who created the problem; "compliance theater."

### Tier 3: Governance
- Board of directors
- Audit committee
- Board-level ethics contact
- Shareholders (if public company)

**When this works:** Governance is independent; board will override management.
**When this fails:** Captured board; no access to governance level.

### Tier 4: Industry/Professional
- Professional licensing boards
- Industry associations
- Certifying bodies

**When this works:** External body has leverage over organization.
**When this fails:** Body is captured or toothless.

### Tier 5: Regulatory/Government
- Inspector General
- Relevant regulatory agency
- Law enforcement

**This is the bridge between internal and external.** Some consider this internal (within the system); others consider it external (outside the organization).

## Documentation Framework

### For Each Attempt, Record:

**The 5 W's:**
- **What:** Exactly what you reported
- **Who:** Who you reported it to (name, title, date)
- **When:** Date and time
- **Where:** Context (meeting, email, phone, hotline)
- **Why:** What you were seeking (investigation, correction, acknowledgment)

**The Response:**
- What did they say/do?
- Was there any follow-up?
- Were there any promises?
- Were those promises kept?
- What was the actual outcome?

**The Evidence:**
- Do you have documentation? (Email, memo, recording if legal)
- Were there witnesses?
- Can this be verified independently?

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

## Constraints

- Document contemporaneously—records created long after the fact are weaker
- Keep copies outside company systems—your access may be revoked
- Know your jurisdiction's recording consent laws before recording
- Some organizations retaliate against any reporting—know the risk
- Internal reporting may alert wrongdoers and give them time to prepare

## Example

**Input:** "I reported accounting irregularities to my manager 6 months ago. She said she'd look into it and never got back to me. I mentioned it to the CFO at a company event and he seemed concerned but nothing happened. I'm thinking about going to the SEC."

**Output:**

## Internal Channel Audit: Accounting Irregularities

### Issue Reported
Accounting irregularities (specific nature to be detailed) identified and reported internally.

### Channel Assessment
| Channel Type | Available? | Tried? | Trustworthy? | Notes |
|--------------|------------|--------|--------------|-------|
| Direct chain | Yes | Partial | Unknown | Manager tried; CFO informal contact only |
| Compliance/Ethics | Likely | No | Unknown | Most companies have ethics hotline; have you checked? |
| Governance | Likely | No | Unknown | Audit committee typically exists for financial concerns |
| Industry/Professional | Possibly | No | N/A | CPA board if licensed accountants involved |
| Regulatory | Yes | No | High | SEC for public company; state AG for private |

### Attempt Timeline

#### Attempt 1: Direct Supervisor
- **Date:** ~6 months ago (exact date needed)
- **Contact:** [Manager name], [Title]
- **Method:** Verbal (in-person? meeting? passing conversation?)
- **Content:** Reported accounting irregularities (need to specify what exactly you reported)
- **Seeking:** Investigation and correction
- **Response:** Said she would "look into it"
- **Documentation:** **NONE RECORDED** - critical gap
- **Follow-up:** None received; no follow-up from you documented

#### Attempt 2: CFO (Informal)
- **Date:** Unknown (at company event, date?)
- **Contact:** CFO, [Name]
- **Method:** Informal conversation at company event
- **Content:** "Mentioned" irregularities (what exactly was said?)
- **Seeking:** Unclear (was this a formal report or casual mention?)
- **Response:** "Seemed concerned"
- **Documentation:** **NONE** - informal conversation, no witnesses documented
- **Follow-up:** None received; none requested

### Futility Assessment
- **Channels exhausted:** None definitively exhausted. Two partial attempts.
- **Channels remaining:**
  - **Ethics/Compliance hotline** - Not tried
  - **Formal written report to CFO** - Informal conversation ≠ formal report
  - **Audit committee** - Not tried (for financial issues, this is the designated oversight)
  - **External auditors** - Not tried (may have independent duty to investigate)
- **Pattern observed:** Insufficient attempts to establish pattern. Two conversations, no follow-up.
- **Conclusion:** **Internal channels not yet exhausted.**

### Documentation Quality
| Attempt | Documentation | Witnesses | Verifiable? |
|---------|---------------|-----------|-------------|
| Manager | None | Unknown | No |
| CFO | None | Possibly (others at event) | Weak |

**Critical problem:** You have no contemporaneous documentation of either report. This will be challenged: "There's no record of any complaint. Are you sure you reported it?"

### Gaps and Recommendations

#### Documentation Gaps
1. No written record of what you reported
2. No written record of responses received
3. Dates are approximate
4. Content of reports is vague

#### Immediate Actions Needed
1. **Create contemporaneous memo NOW:** Write down what you remember—dates, what you said, what they said. Mark it "Reconstruction of prior events as of [today's date]"
2. **Follow up in writing:** Email your manager: "Six months ago I reported concerns about [specifics]. You said you'd look into it. Can you update me on what was found?" This creates a record.
3. **Use formal channels:** File a report through the ethics hotline or compliance system. This creates a dated, formal record.
4. **Request meeting with audit committee chair or designee:** For accounting issues, this is the proper escalation path.

#### Before Going to SEC
SEC whistleblower program has significant benefits (financial reward, anti-retaliation protection), but:
- You'll be asked what internal reporting you did
- Weak internal reporting record may affect credibility
- Better position: "I tried everything internally first"

### External Disclosure Readiness
- **Good faith demonstrated?** **Partially.** You tried but didn't follow up or document.
- **Futility established?** **No.** Two informal attempts without follow-through doesn't establish futility.
- **Ready for external?** **Not yet.**

### Recommended Path Forward

**Week 1:**
1. Create reconstruction memo of past attempts (dated now, noting it's reconstruction)
2. Send follow-up email to manager asking for status
3. Locate company's ethics reporting procedure

**Week 2:**
4. File formal report through ethics/compliance hotline or system
5. Request written acknowledgment

**Weeks 3-6:**
6. Document response (or lack thereof)
7. If no adequate response, escalate to audit committee in writing

**Week 7+:**
8. If internal channels have genuinely failed, now you have documented good-faith attempts
9. Consult whistleblower attorney about SEC filing

**Timeline allows:** Company time to actually respond (they may fix it!), and creates the documented record you need if they don't.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Daniel Ellsberg** expert persona. Ellsberg spent years trying to work within the system before going to the press—briefing officials, approaching senators, seeking declassification. "I had tried everything I could think of to get this information to people who could act on it legitimately. It was only when that failed that I felt I had to act on my own." The internal channel audit establishes that you did the same.
